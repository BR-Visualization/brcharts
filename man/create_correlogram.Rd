\title{Create a correlogram from a given dataframe}
\usage{
create_correlogram(df, diagonal = FALSE, fig_colors = colfun()$fig10_colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing desired variables. Can be
inputted as continuous, binary, or ordinal variables.
Note: Binary variables must have a value of 0 or 1.
Note: Ordinal variables must be formatted as factors.}

\item{diagonal}{Allows user to choose to view the correlogram with diagonal
entries (default is FALSE).}

\item{fig_colors}{Allows the user to change the colors of the figure
(defaults are provided). Must be vector of length 3, with color corresponding
to strength of correlation.}
}
\value{
A correlogram.
}
\description{
Create a correlogram from a given dataframe
}
\details{
Different correlation coefficients are calculated based on the nature of the
variables:
For two continuous variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used.
For two binary variables, the Phi coefficient is implemented.
For one binary and one continuous variable, point biserial correlation is
utilized.
For two ordinal variables, Spearman rank correlation is utilized.
For one continuous and one ordinal variable, a modified Pearson correlation
combined with the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation is used.
For one binary and one ordinal variable, Glass rank biserial correlation
is implemented.
