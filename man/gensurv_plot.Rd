\title{Create a cumulative excess plot from a given dataframe}
\usage{
gensurv_plot(
  df_outcome,
  subjects,
  visits,
  fig_colors = c("#0571b0", "#ca0020"),
  titlename = NULL,
  ben_name = "Primary Efficacy",
  risk_name = "Recurring AE",
  legend_position = c(-0.03, 1.15)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_outcome}{A dataframe with 6 variables named the following:
\enumerate{
\item eventtime: A vector of time points at which an event occurred.
\item diff: A vector containing the difference in active and control effects.
\item obsv_duration: A variable that specifies the duration of the
observational period (numerical).
\item obsv_unit: A variable that specifies the unit for the duration of the
observational period (this is a non-numerical input).
\item outcome: A vector containing whether the outcome is a "Benefit" or "Risk".
\item eff_diff_lbl: A vector containing the label for effect difference.
}}

\item{subjects}{A numerical input that specifies the baseline proportion
of subjects in the study (for example, "per 100 subjects")}

\item{visits}{A numerical input that is the length between normal visits.}

\item{fig_colors}{Allows the user to change the colors of the figure
(defaults are provided). Must be vector of length 2, with color corresponding
to benefit first and risk second.}

\item{titlename}{Allows the user to change the documentation of the title
(default is provided).}

\item{ben_name}{Allows user to specify benefit of interest
(default is provided).}

\item{risk_name}{Allows user to specify risk of interest
(default is provided).}

\item{legend_position}{Allows user to specify legend position. Must be a
vector of length 2, with the first value corresponding to the position of the
legend relative to the x-axis, and the second corresponding to the position
of the legend relative to the y-axis (numeric).}
