\arguments{
\item{df_plot}{A dataframe with 6 variables named the following:
\enumerate{
\item eventtime: A vector of time points at which an event occurred.
\item diff: A vector containing the difference in active and control effects.
\item obsv_duration: A variable that specifies the duration of the
observational period (numerical).
\item obsv_unit: A variable that specifies the unit for the duration of the
observational period (this is a non-numerical input).
\item outcome: A vector containing whether the outcome is a "Benefit" or "Risk".
\item eff_diff_lbl: A vector containing the label for effect difference.
}}

\item{df_table}{A dataframe with 5 variables named the following:
\enumerate{
\item obsv_duration: A variable that specifies the duration of the
observational period (numerical).
\item n: A vector containing a number of subjects who experienced an event
at a given time (numerical).
\item effect: specifies between an active or control effect.
\item outcome: specifies whether the an outcome should be classified as a
"Benefit" or "Risk" (this must have either "Benefit" or "Risk" as values).
\item eff_code: 0 for control and 1 for active effect.
}}

\item{subjects_pt}{A numerical input that specifies the baseline proportion
of subjects in the study.}

\item{visits_pt}{A numerical input that is the length between observational
periods.}

\item{fig_colors_pt}{Allows user to change the colors of the figure (defaults
are provided). Must be vector of length 2, with color corresponding to
benefit first and risk second.}

\item{titlename_p}{Allows user to change the documentation of title (default
is provided)}

\item{rel_heights_table}{Elements for fig vs table size.}

\item{ben_name_p}{Allows user to specify benefit of interest
(default is provided).}

\item{risk_name_p}{Allows user to specify risk of interest
(default is provided).}

\item{legend_position_p}{Allows user to specify legend position. Must be a
vector of length 2, with the first value corresponding to the position of the
legend relative to the x-axis, and the second corresponding to the position
of the legend relative to the y-axis (numeric).}
